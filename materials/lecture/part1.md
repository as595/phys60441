The spatial coherence function measured by a radio interferometer is related to the spectral intensity as,

$$
V(u,v,w) = \int{\frac{I(l,m)}{\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}} {\rm e}^{j 2\pi [ul + vm + w(\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}-1)]}\,{\rm d}l{\rm d}m},
$$

where

 - $(l,m)$ are the direction cosines relative to the phase centre;
 - $I(l,m)$ is the spectral intensity at position $(l,m)$;
 - $(u, v, w)$ is the vector between the two interferometer elements expressed in units of wavelength;
