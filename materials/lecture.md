#### Wide-field Imaging

There are multiple effects that become important when making very wide-field interferometric images: non-coplanarity, primary beam rotation, direction-dependent phase calibration...
In this lecture we will focus on the first of these: non-coplanarity, otherwise known as the w-effect.

The structure of the lecture will be,

(i) an overview of the w-effect,
(ii) various solutions to the w-effect, and
(iii) worked examples.
